# Control of light sensor with DE0-Nano-SoC

This project is part of the Hardware/Software Platforms MA1 course at the Polytechnic Faculty of Mons(https://web.umons.ac.be/fpms/fr/). The goal of this project is to drive the BH1710FVI light sensor with the DE0-Nano-SoC board. 

* Group members: Deffrennes Th√©o (Theo.deffrennes@student.umons.ac.be) and Finet Cyrille (Cyrille.finet@student.umons.ac.be) 
* Project title: Control of a light sensor with the DE0-Nano-SoC board
* Academic year: 2020-2021

The project is mainly implemented with VHDL with a little bit of Verilog and C. The software used is "Quartus Prime Lite edition". 

### 1) BH1710FVI Light sensor and I2C protocol

The BH1710FVI is a digital ambient light sensor with an I2C bus interface. The sensor measures the illuminance in lux (1 lux=1 lumen/m^2). The detection range is from 1 to 65535 lux. Therefore, the data sent from the sensor are coded on 16 bits. 

I2C is a half-duplex bidirectional synchronous serial bus composed of 2 signal lines:
* SDA (Serial Data Line): bidirectional data line
* SCL (Serial Clock Line): bidirectional clock line

The I2C uses a master-slave(s) communication and in the frame of this tutorial, the master is the DE0-Nano-SoC and the slave is the light sensor. 
The scheme of the communication is as follows with first the writing operation (R/W = 0) and the reading operation (R/W = 1) on 2 bytes:

</p>

The slave address of the light sensor is coded on 7 bits:"0100011". 
The opecode is explained in the instruction set architecture of the device and defines the type of resolution (Low, Mid, High) and if the measurement is made once or continuously. 

### 2) VHDL codes

The project included 2 main codes in VHDL:

* The I2C master driver (I2C_M.vhd) which defines the state machine of the I2C protocol.
* The Light bloc (light.vhd) that uses the I2C driver and transfers the data to two output registers of 8 bits for the software.

Testbenches are also included to verify that the codes are working properly.

#### 2.a) I2C master driver

The I2C master state machine is illustrated below. The code that has been implemented follows the operation of the state machine.
